# Overview of the ARM4L Research Lab

The **ARM4L Research Lab** at King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals **(KFUPM)** is part of the Interdisciplinary Research Center for Smart Mobility and Logistics **(IRC-SML)** dedicated to advancing research in **Autonomous Robotic Manipulation for Logistics**. Our focus is on developing **robotic manipulators** capable of operating in constrained environments with high precision and can collaborate with other robots and humans to solve real-world problems related to Automation of Logistics. Our research addresses both the theoretical aspect of robotic manipulation, including dynamic modeling and control system design, as well as practical aspects, including hardware and software integration and real-world testing.
